; Q(a): Explain what was done above. Why canâ€™t we assim-
;       ilate the predicates number? and variable? into the
;       data-directed dispatch?
;
; A: the (static?) dispatch on the operator was replaced by
;    (dynamic?) dispatch, looking up the function to apply
;    with the operator as key.
;    Numbers and variables (symbols) are native types in
;    our programming language. We can't simply tag them.
;    (I guess we could, but that would make constructing
;    expressions kind of awkward.)

; Q(d): In this simple algebraic manipulator the type of an
;       expression is the algebraic operator that binds it to-
;       gether. Suppose, however, we indexed the procedures
;       in the opposite way... What corresponding changes to
;       the derivative system are required?
;
; A: Without testing: I'd say, we'd have to change:
;     - the public interface to e.g. (put '+ 'deriv func)
;    and nothing else because this is only affects how the
;    procedures (methods!?) are stored and retrieved in the
;    table.
