Version A of factorial recurses first and evaluates the multiplier later.
Version B evaluates the multiplier first.

From a high-level perspective there should be no difference in efficiency.

                                    |          (reg env))

Both impementations perform the same number of operations.
Version A needs to save argl before entering the recursion so that the value of n is not lost.
Version B needs to save env before entering the recursion so that it can look up n later.
