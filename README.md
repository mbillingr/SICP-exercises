# SICP-exercises
Whatever I may come up with while working through the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"

Currently this projects contains:
- solutions to most exercises in chapter 1 (34/46)
- solutions to most exercises in chapter 2 (79/97)
- solutions to most exercises in chapter 3 (67/82)
- solutions to almost all exercises in chapter 4 (except partial 4.78 and skipped 4.79)
- solutions to many exercises in chapter 5
- a Scheme interpreter written in Rust that my solutions run on. This interpreter evolved with my progress in the book. 
  Naturally, now that I'm almost through the last chapters, I think I can do better. There are vague plans for the next 
  version of a Rust-embeddable Scheme interpreter/compiler.
  Still, I think the graphical debugger is nice and deserves a screenshot:
