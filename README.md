# SICP-exercises
Whatever I may come up with while working through the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"

Currently this projects contains:
- my solutions to most exercises in chapter 1
- my solutions to some exercises in chapter 2
- an incomplete Scheme interpreter written in Rust that my solutions run on (it grows with my progress in the book).
